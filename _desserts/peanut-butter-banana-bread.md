###Method
Preheat oven to 350°.

To prepare bread, combine first 5 ingredients in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at medium speed. Add granulated and brown sugars; beat until blended.

Weigh or lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife.

Combine flour and next 5 ingredients (through allspice) in a small bowl.

Add flour mixture to banana mixture; beat just until blended. Stir in nuts.
