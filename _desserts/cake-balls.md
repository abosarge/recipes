###Ingredients
* 1 box Dark Chocolate Cake Mix (+ eggs, vegetable oil, and water to follow cake mix instructions)
* 3-6 heaping spoonfuls Chocolate Frosting (can be storebought, or use buttercream frosting recipe)
* 1 package chocolate almond bark
* White or other colored chocolate for drizzling (optional)

###Tools:
* Food Processor
* Candy dipping tool
* Melon Baller

###Method
Bake chocolate cake following directions on back of box. Allow cake to cool, then food process and place cake crumbles in large bowl.

Spoon 3 heaping spoonfuls of icing into bowl with cake crumbles
and mix. Add 1 additional spoonful at a time until cake has a moist, paste-like consistency and sticks together well, with no crumbles left at the bottom of the bowl.

Using melon baller or a spoon, scoop small amounts of the cake/icing mixture into balls, then roll around in hands to create an even, circular shape about 1 in wide and place on a foil covered cookie sheet. Do this until the entire cake mixture is formed into balls.

Melt 1‚ÅÑ2 of the chocolate almond bark bar in medium sized bowl
until smooth and runny (either in double boiler on stove top or in microwave). Take 1 cake ball and place into melted almond bark, making sure that it is immersed in chocolate, then use candy dipping tool to remove chocolate covered ball from the melted chocolate.

Allow excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl, then place ball onto foil covered cookie sheet. The chocolate will harden in a few minutes.

Repeat with all cake balls, making sure to remelt almond bark and add additional almond bark as needed to keep the same shiny, runny consistency with which to cover the cake balls.

If desired, put white or other colored chocolate into small ziplock bag and melt in the microwave. Cut off a very tiny corner of the bag, then force chocolate out of hole using your hands and drizzle over chocolate.

Yield: 75-100 cake balls.
