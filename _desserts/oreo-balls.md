###Ingredients
* (16 ounce) package Oreo cookies, crushed
* 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
* 1 (24 ounce) package white chocolate bark
* 1 (24 ounce) package chocolate bark

###Method
Using a blender or food processor, mix Oreos and cream cheese
together.

Roll into walnut size balls. Chill for an hour.

Melt approximately 3/4 package of white almond bark. Stick a
toothpick in an Oreo ball and dip it in the melted white almond bark. Allow to harden on wax paper, about 15 minutes.

While waiting, melt about 1/4 package of chocolate almond bark.

When Oreo balls are no longer sticky to the touch, decorate with drizzles of chocolate and white almond bark.

Yield: 25-35 Oreo balls.
