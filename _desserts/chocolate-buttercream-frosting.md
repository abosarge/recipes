###Ingredients
* 1 pound bittersweet chocolate
* 12 ounces semisweet chocolate
* 3/4 cup egg whites (4 to 5 extra-large eggs), at room temperature
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 pounds unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 3 teaspoons instant espresso powder, dissolved in 1 1/2 teaspoons water
* 3 tablespoons light rum (optional)

###Method
Melt chocolates in large bowl in microwave.

Mix the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Place the bowl of egg whites over a pan of simmering water and heat the egg whites until they are warm to the touch, about 5 minutes. Return the bowl to the electric mixer and whisk on high speed for 5 minutes, or until the meringue is cool and holds a stiff peak.

Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, while beating on medium
speed. Scrape down the bowl, add the melted chocolate, vanilla,
espresso, and rum, if using, and mix for 1 minute or until the
chocolate is completely blended in. If the buttercream seems very soft, allow it to cool, and beat it again.

Makes 1 gallon ziplock bag-full of icing. Note that buttercream icing freezes well in ziplock bags and can be thawed and refrozen several times.
