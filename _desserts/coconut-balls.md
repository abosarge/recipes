###Method
In a large bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar, coconut, almonds and milk. Shape into 1-in. balls. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.

In a microwave, melt semisweet chips and shortening on high for
about 1 minute; stir. Microwave at additional 10- to 20-second
intervals, stirring until smooth.

Store in an airtight container.
