<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), divided</li>
  <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 white onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
  <li>3/4 cup white wine</li>
  <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
  <li>10 sage leaves, chopped</li>
  <li>1 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
  <li>1 pound gnocchi</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat to cook the gnocchi.</p>

<p>While the water is coming up to a boil, place a medium size skillet with one tablespoon of EVOO over medium-high heat. Add the sirloin, then season it with salt and pepper and brown it until caramelized, five minutes, breaking it up with a wooden spoon into bite-size crumbles.</p>

<p>Add the onion and garlic to the pan and soften for five minutes. Adjust the salt and pepper, then add wine to the pan and stir for one minute. Stir in the chicken stock and sage, then the gorgonzola. Reduce the heat to low. </p>

<p>Cook the gnocchi in boiling, salted water for 2-3 minutes, until they float. Drain the gnocchi and toss with the beef and cheese mixture. Allow gnocchi, beef, and cheese to simmer for 20 minutes until sauce is thick, then serve.</p>
