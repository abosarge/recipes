###Ingredients
* 3 oz Rotini pasta (other types work too)
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 can tomato soup (I like Amy’s brand)
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 8 oz shredded cheese, any kind 


###Method
Got everything? Good. Let’s get cookin’, guh.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Oil a casserole dish.

Cook and drain the pasta. Set aside.

Oil a medium to large frying pan. Cook the onion, stirring
frequently, until translucent. Add the ground beef. Brown the beef on medium heat; break it up into chunks as it cooks. Once the meat is fully browned, drain any extra oil from the pan.

Now for the good stuff! Pour your can of tomato sauce into the pan. Mix it with the beef until it’s nice and meaty and tomato-y. Add the pasta and keep mixing. Last but certainly not least, add le fromage.

Tip: Save some cheese. You’ll thank me later.

Once all ingredients are well-combined and the cheese has achieved gooey perfection, pour the contents into your casserole dish, and even it out with a spatula. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.

Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.

After 30 minutes, remove from the oven and mange your heart out. Congratulations! You are now a master chef.
