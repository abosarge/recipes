###Ingredients
  * 1⁄2 cup oil
  * 1 cup flour
  * 1 1⁄2 cup chopped onion
  * 1 8oz can tomato sauce
  * 8 cups hot water (because chicken releases water, I add only 7 cups of water)
  * 3/4 cup chopped green pepper
  * 2 large cloves garlic
  * 1 Tbsp salt
  * 3/4 tsp cayenne
  * 1/2 cup green onions
  * 1 lb (ish) of chicken (I buy the chicken breast on the bone)
  * Rice (of course)


###Method
Make a roux: Heat oil, stir flour and cook over medium heat stirring all the time until the roux is brown (I leave it medium brown).

Add chopped onions and cook till tender. Add tomato sauce and cook over low heat for 15 minute longer.

Slowly add hot water stirring until smooth.

Stir in green pepper, garlic, cayenne, salt and bring to a boil and cook uncovered for 1 hr.

Add uncooked chicken and green onions and cook another 1/2 hr.

Remove chicken to make sure it is cooked through. Cut it up into bite-sized pieces and return to the pot.

<i>Note: If you want to add sausage, buy a good quality sausage and cook it first before adding to gumbo. Add at the very end.</i>
