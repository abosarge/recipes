<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1⁄2 cup oil</li>
  <li>1 cup flour</li>
  <li>1 1⁄2 cup chopped onion</li>
  <li>1 8oz can tomato sauce</li>
  <li>8 cups hot water (because chicken releases water, I add only 7 cups of water)</li>
  <li>3/4 cup chopped green pepper</li>
  <li>2 large cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1 Tbsp salt</li>
  <li>3/4 tsp cayenne</li>
  <li>1/2 cup green onions</li>
  <li>1 lb (ish) of chicken (I buy the chicken breast on the bone)</li>
  <li>Rice (of course)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Make a roux: Heat oil, stir flour and cook over medium heat stirring all the time until the roux is brown (I leave it medium brown).</p>

<p>Add chopped onions and cook till tender. Add tomato sauce and cook over low heat for 15 minute longer.</p>

<p>Slowly add hot water stirring until smooth.</p>

<p>Stir in green pepper, garlic, cayenne, salt and bring to a boil and cook uncovered for 1 hr.</p>

<p>Add uncooked chicken and green onions and cook another 1/2 hr.</p>

<p>Remove chicken to make sure it is cooked through. Cut it up into bite-sized pieces and return to the pot.</p>

<p><i>Note: If you want to add sausage, buy a good quality sausage and cook it first before adding to gumbo. Add at the very end.</i></p>
