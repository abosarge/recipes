###Ingredients
* 2 chicken breasts
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup Japanese-style bread crumbs (panko)
* 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
* 2 tbsp salted butter
* 2 tbsp Chardonnay wine
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1/2 tsp granulated sugar
* Dash salt
* 2/3 cups heavy cream
* 2 tbsp parmesan cheese (optional)
* 2 tsp minced sun-dried tomatoes (optional)
* 2 tbsp thinly sliced fresh basil (optional)


###Method
Pound chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch thick with a kitchen mallet. If breasts are large, cut them in half.

Beat eggs in a medium bowl, and pour flour onto a plate. Combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper in another medium bowl. Coat each fillet with flour, then egg, then the Parmesan mixture.

Make chardonnay butter sauce by melting butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add wine and simmer 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice, sugar and salt then add cream. Simmer on low heat for 10-12 minutes, until thicker.

Add enough oil to cover the bottom of a large saute pan, and heat over medium/low until hot. Saut√© each breaded chicken fillet in oil for 4-5 minutes per side or until brown. Remove fillets to a paper towel-covered plate until ready to serve. Spoon butter sauce over top of fillets, then optionally add a tbsp of Parmesan cheese and basil and a tsp sun dried tomatoes.
