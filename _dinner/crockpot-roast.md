  *  1 packet dried Italian dressing

  *  1⁄2 packet dried brown gravy   
  *  1⁄2 white onion

###Method
Place roast in crockpot. Chop up half of a white onion and put into crock pot with roast.

Cook on low for 8 hours. If crock pot is large, add more water/beef broth and lessen cooking time to prevent dryness.
