###Ingredients
* 1/2 cup water
* 3 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup flour
* 2 eggs
* 3 ounces Gruyère cheese, grated (about 3/4 cup)

###Method
In a small, heavy bottomed saucepan, heat without boiling, water, butter, and salt. When the butter has melted, stir the flour in, all at once. Keep stirring vigorously until the mixture coheres, and pulls away from the side of pan. Keep stirring for another minute over the heat. Dough should be a smooth mass. Transfer to a mixing bowl to cool slightly, stirring will speed up this process.

Beat in each egg, one at a time. Egg should be thoroughly mixed into the dough before the next is added. Stir in the grated cheese.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking pan with parchment. Spoon the dough onto baking sheet, approximately 1 tablespoon in diameter, and about 2 inches apart. You may need to smooth each spoonful with a wet finger, or gougères can be piped out, using a plain 1/2 inch tip.

Bake undisturbed for 10 minutes at 400 degrees, then drop the temperature to 375 degrees and continue to bake for 10-15 minutes. Gougères should be golden brown and outside. With a sharp knife, pierce the bottom of each warm puff, to let out any steam, and help the puff stay crisp. Eat right away, or puff can be reheated at 375 degrees for 3 minutes.

Makes approximately 20 puffs.
